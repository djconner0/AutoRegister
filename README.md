# AutoRegister

This is a simple Python script that logs in and pushes a button. I don't have a way to test on Mac, but I imagine it's similar to a Linux boot.

## Getting Started

- Download the script
- Install Prerequisites
	
### Windows
- Open script in the Python IDLE
- Run
- Run Module

### Linux
- Open Terminal
- Navigate to script
- > python3 AutoRegister2020.py
	

### Prerequisites

 - [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/)
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [Chrome WebDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)

## Running the tests

The test script will accept inputs, but it won't check the time, so it just runs.
