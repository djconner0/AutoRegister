# AutoRegister
This is an Auto Registration Script for UAH.

Prerequisites:
  Python3
  Selenium
  Chrome Webdriver (Can be replaced by Firefox or IE, but Chrome doesn't clean cookies and it works)
  
Input examples (ensure that format is followed):
  Registration MM-DD: 05-04
  Registration HH: 08
  Registration MM: 00
  Charger ID: username
  Password: password
  
Login details are sent straight to the my.uah.edu login page, you can verify in source.
If I can't figure out an easier way to do inputs, I also can't figure out how to steal login creds.
